"I now tend to add some books that dig still further into foundational topics. In particular, I recommend A. Tsybakov's book "Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation" as a very readable source for the tools for obtaining lower bounds on estimators, and Y. Nesterov's very readable "Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization" as a way to start to understand lower bounds in optimization. I also recommend A. van der Vaart's "Asymptotic Statistics", a book that we often teach from at Berkeley, as a book that shows how many ideas in inference (M estimation---which includes maximum likelihood and empirical risk minimization---the bootstrap, semiparametrics, etc) repose on top of empirical process theory. I'd also include B. Efron's "Large-Scale Inference: Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing, and Prediction", as a thought-provoking book"
